# weather-dashboard
## This is my weather dashboard. I feel like it has been sewn together with things I made up (in a way, all functions are made up) and things I found on the internet.
## The styles are a little weird. I need a little more time to understand bootstrap as I still don't get it. I still don't really get why things don't look how I want them to.
